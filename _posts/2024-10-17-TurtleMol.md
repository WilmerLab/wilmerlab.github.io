*October 17th, 2024*

TurtleMol is an open-source Python package developed to enable the construction of large, complex molecular systems with maximal flexibility. Functioning as a molecular CAD tool, TurtleMol empowers users to generate atomistic models based on fundamental geometric primitives or user-defined 3D mesh files created in modeling programs such as Blender or SolidWorks. Designed for both generality, it supports diverse system architecturesâ€”from crystalline solids to disordered fluids. TurtleMol is available on GitHub at [TurtleMol](https://github.com/Dfilono/TurtleMol) and is also accessible as a script plugin within Avogadro2.
