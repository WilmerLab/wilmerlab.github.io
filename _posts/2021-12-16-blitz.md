Oct 15, 2021

Last week, FlowCell team members Becca and Salem (Carnegie Mellon masters in material science student working with Dr. Jay Whitacre) were one of three first place winners of the Big Idea Blitz, a 24-hour virtual pitch competition. They won a fast-pass to the final round of Randall Family Big Idea Competition in the Spring. The pitched idea was FlowCell, an electrochemical battery testing system which will speed up flow battery researchersâ€™ optimization and analyzation of electrolyte materials. Special thanks to James and Dr. Chris Wilmer for working with Becca on the idea and business venture. Great Job Team!
