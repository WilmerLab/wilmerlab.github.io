FlowCellutions won first prize in the Kuzneski Cup! This was a competition officiated by Pitt’s Big Idea Center sponsored by the Kuzneski family. The team consisted of Becca from our lab, Priscilla from Fullerton Lab, and Salem, an M.S. student in Material Science at CMU. The competition was a 5 minute pitch with 15 minute questions, and then a virtual showcase (3 min elevator pitch) of the finalist teams. The team won $10k as first prize! Great job Becca and FlowCellutions!!
